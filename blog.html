              <p>grief? regrets? pain? sorrow? sad moods? upset you? okay..wait Calm down and listen ! Take a breath and let it go!!! You will never ever have to force anything which is meant to be.
Life will give you hundereds and a thousand reason to cry...to give up..to settle down but Remember <b>give a bash to your life saying God has blessed me with all powers their within me.</b> Feel the magic..Feel the unique you..feel the change and here you go with the best you!
It's not about being popular, being highly educated or being perfect. It's about real, being humble and most importantly it's about <b>Being Yourself.</b> Remember my unique smiling souls reading this that <b>you go perfect by being the imperfect you. You go unique by being the real you.</b>

              <p>I smiled because I have survived everything the world have thrown at me. I smiled because when I have a knock down, I always have a back-up.
Look around..open your eyes..think for a while and then start again..you will have a selective list of people caring for you..believing you..admiring you and most importantly dying to have your grin. Always look forward with a hope not backward with a regret! What all happened was meant to be as it was..People show up their colours and now all you need to do is
keep your mistakes at your feet make them your stepping stones in your success destiny. Remember <b>their is only one you and no one has the right to make yourself feel sad!</b>
Be strong..don't forget that you always inspire someone by being yourself!</p>
